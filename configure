# Everything that needs to be done before building the package goes here:

# download jar file from artifactory
# note, this gets version 174.0.  To change versions requires changing the following line in two places
export srcjar=http://sagebionetworks.artifactoryonline.com/sagebionetworks/libs-releases-local/org/sagebionetworks/lib-auto-generated/174.0/lib-auto-generated-174.0.jar
wget -O temp.jar $srcjar

	curl -o temp.jar $srcjar
fi
if [ "$?" -ne "0" ]; then
  echo "Failed to download $srcjar"
  exit 1
fi

# extract schema into inst/resources
unzip -oq temp.jar -d inst/resources
# clean up downloaded jar file
rm temp.jar

# build the .Rd files
# Note:  We want to just call 'tools/docGen/createRdFiles.R .' but it doesn't work on cygwin (Windows)
Rscript tools/docGen/createRdFiles.R .
