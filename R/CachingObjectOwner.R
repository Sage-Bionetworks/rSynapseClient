## object CRUD calls should deletage to the enclosedEnhanced environment
## must assign the return value for Enhanced Environment calls back to the
## "objects" slot since Enhanced Environment is pass-by-copy. This isn't
## totally necessary for this implementation, but will be for subclasses
## that store in memory member variables as well as enclosing an basic "environment"
## class

##
## Since data frames are a type of list, we need to customize thier behavior.By default
## unlist should be FALSE for data frames
##

##
## when the object names isn't provided, it should keep the same names as it had
## in the parent frame. this can lead to some wierd object names, so generally it's
## safest to simply specify the name

## return the environment wrapped by the enclosed EnhancedEnvironment class
## should this be done? May not need this method since it encourages callers
## not to use the API. Commenting it out for now and will add it back later if
